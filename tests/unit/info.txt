This directory contains all unit tests for go microservices

Tests are split up into a directory per microservices, allowing for
unique setup/teardown per service.

In <microservice>_test.go, setup/teardown can be added to the TestMain
function. This will occur before all tests are ran. Additional files can
be added per microservice directory if needed.
